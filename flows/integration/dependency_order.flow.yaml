# Integration test: Dependency order
# NOTE: Current implementation does NOT enforce depends_on order
# Steps execute in the order they appear in the YAML file
# This test documents the current behavior (NOT the ideal behavior)

name: dependency_order_test
on: cli.manual

steps:
  # Step C appears first but depends on step_b
  - id: step_c
    use: core.log
    with:
      message: "Step C - appears first, depends on B"
    depends_on:
      - step_b

  # Step A has no dependencies
  - id: step_a
    use: core.log
    with:
      message: "Step A - no dependencies"

  # Step B depends on step_a
  - id: step_b
    use: core.log
    with:
      message: "Step B - depends on A"
    depends_on:
      - step_a

# CURRENT BEHAVIOR (not ideal):
# Execution order: step_c → step_a → step_b
# (Order determined by position in YAML, not by depends_on)
#
# IDEAL BEHAVIOR (future enhancement):
# Execution order: step_a → step_b → step_c
# (Order determined by topological sort of dependencies)
