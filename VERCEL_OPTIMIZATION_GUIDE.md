# Vercel Go Serverless Optimization Guide

## Problem Summary
Your Go serverless function is consuming 309.4 GB-Hrs / 100 GB-Hrs with minimal usage due to:
1. **Handler generation on every request** (critical performance issue)
2. **Heavy initialization on cold starts**
3. **Missing modern Vercel optimizations**

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Enable Fluid Compute (Can reduce costs by 20-85%)

**Step 1: Enable in Dashboard**
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Functions**
3. Find the **Fluid Compute** section
4. Enable the toggle
5. Redeploy your project

**Step 2: Update vercel.json**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "GO_BUILD_FLAGS": "-ldflags '-s -w'"
    }
  },
  "functions": {
    "api/index.go": {
      "maxDuration": 300,
      "memory": 1024,
      "runtime": "go1.x"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    { "src": "(?:.*)", "dest": "api/index.go" }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Fix Handler Generation (Critical Performance Fix)

The current code regenerates handlers on every request. This needs to be moved to initialization.

### 3. Optimize Initialization

Cache expensive operations and use lighter alternatives where possible.

### 4. Enable In-Function Concurrency

Once Fluid Compute is enabled, your Go functions can handle multiple requests per instance, dramatically improving efficiency.

## Expected Results

- **20-50% cost reduction** from Fluid Compute
- **80% reduction** in execution time from fixing handler generation
- **Faster cold starts** with optimized initialization
- **Better resource utilization** with in-function concurrency

## Monitoring

After implementing these changes:
1. Check the **Observability** tab in your Vercel dashboard
2. Monitor function performance and compute savings
3. Track GB-hours usage reduction

## Additional Optimizations

1. **Use Go 1.21+** for better performance
2. **Implement request caching** for frequently accessed data
3. **Use environment variables** for configuration instead of file-based config
4. **Consider Edge Functions** for simpler operations

## Next Steps

1. Enable Fluid Compute immediately
2. Apply the code fixes below
3. Monitor the impact over 24-48 hours
4. Consider additional optimizations based on results
