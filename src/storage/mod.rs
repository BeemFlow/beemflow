//! Storage backends for BeemFlow
//!
//! Provides multiple storage backends with a unified trait interface.
//!
//! The storage layer is split into focused traits following Interface Segregation Principle:
//! - `RunStorage`: Run and step execution tracking
//! - `FlowStorage`: Flow definition management and versioning
//! - `OAuthStorage`: OAuth credentials, providers, clients, and tokens
//! - `StateStorage`: Paused runs and wait tokens for durable execution
//! - `Storage`: Composition trait implementing all of the above
