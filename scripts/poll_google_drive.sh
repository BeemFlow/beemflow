# Google Drive Polling Script
# This script monitors a Google Drive folder for new files
# Example cron entry (every 10 minutes):
# */10 * * * * /path/to/beemflow/scripts/poll_google_drive.sh

# Set the BeemFlow directory
BEEMFLOW_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"

# Load environment variables if .env exists
if [ -f "$BEEMFLOW_DIR/.env" ]; then
    export $(cat "$BEEMFLOW_DIR/.env" | grep -v '^#' | xargs)
fi

# Check for required environment variable
if [ -z "$GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID" ]; then
    echo "Error: GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID not set"
    exit 1
fi

# State file to track processed files
STATE_FILE="$BEEMFLOW_DIR/.beemflow/drive_state.json"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$STATE_FILE")"

# Initialize state file if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -f "$STATE_FILE" ]; then

# This is a placeholder for actual Google Drive API calls
# In production, you would use the Google Drive API to list files
# For now, we'll simulate with a simple check

echo "Checking Google Drive folder: $GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID"

# Placeholder: In a real implementation, you would:
# 1. Use Google Drive API to list files in the folder
# 2. Compare with processed files in state file
# 3. Emit events for new files

# Example of how to emit an event for a new file:
# curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/events \
#   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
#   -d '{
#     "topic": "google.drive.new_file",
#     "data": {
#       "fileId": "NEW_FILE_ID",
#       "fileName": "example.txt",
#       "folderId": "'$GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID'",
#       "timestamp": "'$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")'"
#     }
#   }'

echo "Google Drive check completed at $(date)"
