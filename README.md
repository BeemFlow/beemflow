## What is BeemFlow?

BeemFlow is an open protocol and runtime for AI-powered, event-driven automations. It provides a **protocol-agnostic, consistent interface** for flows and tools‚ÄîCLI, HTTP, and MCP clients all speak the same language. Whether you're running a flow, discovering tools, or integrating with LLMs, you use the same concepts and API surface everywhere.

- **Text-first:** Write, share, and run workflows in YAML.
- **Interoperable:** Local, HTTP, and MCP tools are all available in a single, LLM-native registry.
- **Composable:** Chain tools, orchestrate workflows, and expose flows as tools for LLMs and clients.
- **Extensible:** Add new tools or adapters with zero boilerplate.

**Registry Resolution:** By default, BeemFlow uses `registry/index.json` if present. If not, it falls back to the public hub at `https://hub.beemflow.com/index.json`. You can override this with the `BEEMFLOW_REGISTRY` environment variable.

---

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/awantoch/beemflow.git
   cd beemflow
   ```
2. **Run an example flow:**
   ```bash
   flow run hello
   # or add your OPENAI_API_KEY to .env and try another example:
   flow run fetch_and_summarize
   flow run parallel_openai
   ```

---

## Core Concepts

- **Flows:** YAML files that define event-driven automations as a sequence of steps.
- **Steps:** Each step calls a tool (local, HTTP, or MCP) with inputs and produces outputs.
- **Adapters:** Pluggable integrations for HTTP APIs, LLMs, MCP servers, and custom logic.
- **Registry:** All tools‚Äîlocal manifests, MCP endpoints, remote registries‚Äîare auto-discovered and available in a single, LLM-native registry.
- **Protocol-Agnostic Interface:** Manage flows and tools the same way via CLI, HTTP, or MCP. Everything is interoperable and consistent.

---

## Protocol-Agnostic Interface

BeemFlow exposes a **consistent, protocol-agnostic interface** for running, managing, and introspecting flows and tools. Whether you use the CLI, HTTP API, or MCP protocol, you:
- List, run, and inspect flows
- Resume paused flows (durable waits)
- Validate and test flows
- Discover and call tools (from any source)
- Interact with the assistant for LLM-driven flow authoring

**See the [Full Protocol & Spec](docs/spec.md) for canonical details, endpoints, and request/response formats.**

## Real-World Examples

### Hello World
```yaml
name: hello
on: cli.manual
steps:
  - id: greet
    use: core.echo
    with:
      text: "Hello, BeemFlow!"
  - id: print
    use: core.echo
    with:
      text: "{{.outputs.greet.text}}"
```
Run it:
```bash
flow run hello
```

### Fetch and Summarize
```yaml
name: fetch_and_summarize
on: cli.manual
steps:
  - id: fetch
    use: http.fetch
    with:
      url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/Artificial_intelligence"
  - id: summarize
    use: openai
    with:
      model: "gpt-4o"
      messages:
        - role: system
          content: "Summarize the following text in 3 bullet points."
        - role: user
          content: "{{.outputs.fetch.body}}"
  - id: print
    use: core.echo
    with:
      text: "{{.outputs.summarize.choices[0].message.content}}"
```
Run it:
```bash
flow run fetch_and_summarize
```

### Parallel OpenAI (Fanout/Fanin)
```yaml
name: parallel_openai
on: cli.manual
steps:
  - id: fanout
    parallel: true
    steps:
      - id: chat1
        use: openai
        with:
          model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
          messages:
            - role: user
              content: "Prompt 1"
      - id: chat2
        use: openai
        with:
          model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
          messages:
            - role: user
              content: "Prompt 2"
  - id: combine
    depends_on: [fanout]
    use: core.echo
    with:
      text: |
        Combined responses:\n
        - chat1: {{.outputs.fanout.chat1.choices[0].message.content}}
        - chat2: {{.outputs.fanout.chat2.choices[0].message.content}}
```
Run it:
```bash
flow run parallel_openai
```

## Extending BeemFlow

- **Add a local tool:** Drop a JSON-Schema manifest in `tools/`.
- **Add an MCP server:** Add a config in `mcp_servers/` and reference it in your config file.
- **Add a remote tool:** Reference a remote registry or GitHub manifest.
- **Write a custom adapter:** Implement the `Adapter` interface in Go.

All tools are auto-discovered and available in the registry, ready for use in flows, CLI, HTTP, MCP, or LLMs.

## FAQ

**Q: What's the difference between local, HTTP, and MCP tools?**
A: All are available in the same registry and can be used interchangeably in flows. Local tools are static manifests, HTTP tools are described by endpoint, and MCP tools are auto-discovered from MCP servers.

**Q: How do I override or extend the registry?**
A: Add a local manifest or MCP server config. You can shadow, extend, or remix tools without forking or duplicating JSON.

**Q: Can I host my own registry?**
A: Yes! Anyone can host a registry (even on a static website). BeemFlow comes with a default open registry out of the box, but you can add or override as needed.

# Beemflow MCP Registry Integration

## Multi-Registry Support

Beemflow now supports multiple MCP registries (e.g., Smithery, local/unified) via a unified interface. You can:
- Search, list, and install MCP servers from all configured registries.
- Add new registries via environment variables or config.

## Namespacing and Registry-Qualified Names

When multiple registries are enabled, tool/server names are qualified by their registry:
- Format: `<registry>:<name>` (e.g., `smithery:airtable`, `local:mytool`)
- All CLI and API output includes a `REGISTRY` column.
- If a name is ambiguous (exists in more than one registry), you must specify the qualified name.
- If only one match exists, you can use the unqualified name for convenience.

### Example CLI Output

```
flow mcp list

REGISTRY   NAME         DESCRIPTION         KIND      ENDPOINT
smithery   airtable     Airtable MCP API   mcp_server  ...
local      mytool       My Local Tool      mcp_server  ...
```

### Example: Install

```
flow mcp install smithery:airtable
flow mcp install local:mytool
```

If ambiguous:
```
flow mcp install mytool
# Error: 'mytool' found in multiple registries. Please specify one of:
#   smithery:mytool
#   local:mytool
```

## Configuration

### Smithery Registry
- Set your Smithery API key:
  ```sh
  export SMITHERY_API_KEY=your-smithery-api-key
  ```

### Local/Unified Registry
- By default, Beemflow will look for `registry/index.json`.
- To override, set:
  ```sh
  export BEEMFLOW_REGISTRY=/path/to/your/registry.json
  ```

## CLI Usage

- List all MCP servers:
  ```sh
  flow mcp list
  ```
- Search for MCP servers:
  ```sh
  flow mcp search [query]
  ```
- Install an MCP server (qualified name recommended):
  ```sh
  flow mcp install smithery:airtable
  flow mcp install local:mytool
  ```

All commands aggregate results from all configured registries and display the registry-qualified name.

## Adding More Registries

To add more registry integrations, implement the `MCPRegistry` interface in `registry/` and add it to the registry manager in the CLI/API setup.

## Migration Notes
- All Smithery-specific CLI commands have been removed in favor of the unified interface.
- The system is DRY, extensible, and production-grade.

## Registries: Curated vs Local

BeemFlow supports two types of registries:

- **Curated registry**: A read-only, repo-managed set of tools, always loaded from `registry/index.json`. This is the default set of tools provided by BeemFlow and can be split into a community repo in the future.
- **Local registry**: A user-writable registry, by default at `.beemflow/local_registry.json`, where any tool installed via the CLI is saved. This allows you to extend or override the curated set with your own tools.

### How it works
- On startup, BeemFlow loads both the curated and local registries.
- When listing or using tools, local entries take precedence over curated ones (by tool name).
- Any tool installed via the CLI is written to the local registry file, never to the curated registry.
- All config roots (db, files, registries) default to `.beemflow/` for a clean, user-specific experience.
- The system is future-proofed for remote/community registries (coming soon).

### Sample config
```json
{
  "storage": { "driver": "sqlite", "dsn": ".beemflow/flow.db" },
  "blob": { "driver": "filesystem", "bucket": "", "directory": ".beemflow/files" },
  "registries": [
    { "type": "local", "path": ".beemflow/local_registry.json" }
  ],
  "http": { "host": "localhost", "port": 8080 },
  "log": { "level": "info" }
}
```

### Example: Merging
If you have a tool `foo` in both the curated and local registries, the local version will be used.

### No legacy/old-style registry logic
All registry logic is config-driven and future-proof. No backwards compatibility is needed.
